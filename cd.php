	The Prairie Cyber Defense teams work together studying network security and managing web services. Along with developing and hosting this site, we work on managing GNU/Linux systems, writing secure web applications, and safely hosting sensitive information. Over the course of the year we will be learning from each other and doing a community service project. In the Spring, we put our skills to the test in the Cyber Defense Competition at Iowa State University. There we will have to secure a web system they provide, and professionals will attempt to infultrate our servers throughout the day. We will need to respond to attacks, complete challenges throughout the day as they come, and keep our services functional.

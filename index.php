<p>How am I supposed to watch a anime on a sushi?</p>
<p>All the kids, come downtown to see Ranglin' Rascal's Robberscraps. Next Thursday, Next Friday, Next Saturday, all days.
All days. We're here always! We don't get much visitors. I just felt like extending the length of this ad. Come on down! ...
Come on up! Whatever direction relative to the place that you are!  No matter where you are from here, go. Go as the crow
flies, we have teleporters!

	VREP stands for Virtual Reality Education Pathfinders. Our team works with 3D modeling software, mainly Blender, to produce art or real world simulations. They also produce graphic designs. The PHS VREP team meets weekly every Friday morning at 8 a.m. Our team is very dedicated to what they do, and each and every member is very talented in creating the various media they produce. The PHS VREP team attends an annual conference and some of the team members show off some of their creations.

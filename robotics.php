	Our Robotics teams at Prairie HS work with Lego Robotics kits to build robots that can accompplish a given task. We have two teams--one which works with an NXT robot, and another that uses an EV3 robot. They must build their robots to be mechanically efficiant, and then program them to function as intended. In the Spring, they travel to Ames to compete in the IT Olympics. There they will need to have a robot prepared to win a sumo tournament, and will also be challenged to build robots on the spot to complete provided tasks.
